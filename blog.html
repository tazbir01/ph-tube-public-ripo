                <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h4>
                <p><span class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600">Ans:</span> Scope means where variables are available for use. Lets discuss about the scope of var, ler and const.<br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">var scope:</span> var scope is global scop. Global scop means var can declared outside a function. Var is also function scoped when it declared within a finction. We can redeclare var variables and update variables. var variables are hoisted to the top of their scop.
                    <br><span class="font-semibold">let scope:</span> let variable is block scoped. Block scope is inside of second brackets '{}'. That meana let variables only available inside of block. We can not redeclare let but let can be updated.
                    <br><span class="font-semibold">const scope:</span> const variable is also block scoped. But const cannot be updated or re-declared.

                <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h4>
                <p><span class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600">Ans:</span> Here is the answer of the use case of null and undefined lets see:
                    <br><span class="font-semibold">null:</span> 'null' in JavaScript means an empty value. If variable has been assigned as null contains no value. 'null' is an object in JavaScript. An object can be emptied by setting it to null. Type of 'null' is objedt.
                    <br><span class="font-semibold">undefined:</span> 'undefined' means not defined. If we declared a variable but do not assign a value to is, the variable become undefined. Type of 'undefined' is undefined.

                <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">What do you mean by REST API?</h4>
                <p><span class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600">Ans:</span> Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
                <br>A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.
                <br>In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="font-semibold">GET:</span> The HTTP GET method is used to read a representation of a resource. In the safe path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST). 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="font-semibold">POST:</span> The POST verb is most often utilized to create new resources. In particular, it’s used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="font-semibold">PUT:</span> It is used for updating the capabilities. However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. PUT is not safe operation but it’s idempotent.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="font-semibold">PATCH:</span> It is used to modify capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch. PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="font-semibold">DELETE:</span> It is used to delete a resource identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.
